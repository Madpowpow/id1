                <p>For the majority of my life I have loved to draw. I can still remember, at an age where you don’t remember much, waking up on Christmas morning and getting a Crayola easel from my dad and being beyond ecstatic. My mom constantly talks about how I was a brat when I was a kid because if one of my crayons broke I would abandon the entire pack and ask for a new one because that single crayon had fallen shorter than the rest. I remember suiting up in an old shirt of my dads, that dragged beneath my feet when I walked because it was so huge, armed with my finger paints and crayons to go make a mess with my imagination on that easel. I dreamt of one day becoming an artist. As I grew that dream shrunk. It wasn’t until my senior year in high school that I found graphic design.</p>
                <p>I had taken art classes all through out school but never saw a practical application for them. By a twist of fate, the AP Psychology class I wanted to take my senior year was filled so I was placed into an intro to graphic design class. I fell in love fast and hard with graphic design. So much so, that my English teacher hardly ever made me come to class, she sent me into the design classroom every morning to work on posters and signs for her. I even ended up makings her son’s graduation party banners. I found graphic design at the perfect time, because I was in the middle of having an existential crisis, I had no clue what in the hell was I going to do with the rest of my life. Then, bam, I was hit with something I loved, something I enjoyed doing, something I was passionate about. Confucius said it best “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”, and that’s what I have found with graphic design.</p>
                <p>My aspiration as a designer is, in a world so ugly and full of hate, I want to make something beautiful.</p>
