        <p>Celebrities have banded together for a viral internet fundraising campaign to help offset the humanitarian crisis in Somalia, raising more than $2 million in less a week from nearly 80,000 contributors and counting.</p>
        <p>The plan: to fill a cargo plane with food destined for the emergency zone in Somlia. Actor Ben Stiller and athlete Colin Kaepernick, plus social media influencers and creators like Casey Neistat, Jerome Jarre, Chakabars Clarke, Juanpa Zurita, and Amanda Cerny combined their celebrity status to rally a "Love Army for Somalia" online, imploring their shared millions, and millions of followers and friends to contribute to relief efforts in a GoFundMe.</p>
        <p>The campaign can be traced back to France's Jerome Jarre, social media heavyweight, who got his start on the app Vine. He took to social media, twitter specifically, on March 15th to ask Turkish Airlines to deliver life saving supplies to Somalia. The region, as Jarre noted, has been hit by a deadly drought. It's already taken the lives of plenty, and is expected to escalate.</p>
