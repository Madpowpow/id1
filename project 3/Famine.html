        <section><h2>"Over six million people are in need of food assistance in Somalia; more than half the country's population"</h2></section>
        <p>The drought, impending famine and the presence of Al-Shabaab, a terrorist group, have left the country and its people in a desperate situation. The International Organization for Migration has warned that if "action is not taken immediately, early warning signals point towards a growing humanitarian crisis in Somalia of potentially catastrophic proportions."</p> <p>The drought has taken the Somlians animals and land, and now hunger is taking their population. Over six million people are in need of food assistance in Somalia; more than half the country's population. The UN has estimated that up to half a million children will suffer acute malnutrition in the country this year. Many who survive will face related health problems throughout their lives.
