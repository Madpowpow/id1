        <p>The situation in Somalia is only going to escalate. With Somalia's current political and environment status they may be doomed to loose over half their population. To lessen their suffering there are humanitarian groups such as the Red Cross that are attempting to help. In order to help the situation in Somalia the Red Cross must raise $300 million to deliver emergency assistance to a total of five million people, although, six million people are in need of assistance. </p>
        <p>The Love Army for Somalia was just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to relief in Somalia, and they are continuing to accept donations through their GoFundMe page. </p>
