        <h1>The state of the world</h1>
        <p>I love many things about the world we live in, one being people. The world is full of them. The people in my life are nothing short of amazing.</p>
        <p>I don't hate much in this world except intolerance.</p>
        <p>I wouldn't change a thing about the world. Anne Frank's quote, "Despite everything, I belive that people are really good at heart." sums up my view on the world. People and things are innately good. But sometimes mistakes must be made to create progress.</p>
