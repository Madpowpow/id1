                    <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
                    <p>For pull quotes and headers they use a scrawled handwriting which reminds me of electricity which goes along so well with the bands music, for the body they use a serif font that is easy to read against the crazy background. 
                    </p>
                    <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
                    <p>The color pallet is all pastels, what reminds me of Easter colors. The colors are pastel blue, pink, yellow, and green. They are used mostly in the wobbling background.
                    </p>
                    <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
                    <p>The visuals are hilarious and really exhibit the bands fun and eccentric vibe. 
                    </p>
                    <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
                    <p>Sections are separated by the rolling visuals and pull quotes and bold san-serif typeface.
