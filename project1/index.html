        <h1><strong>Chance the Rapper</strong></h1>
        <p>Picking my favorite musical artist is next to impossible so I’m going to choose the musical artist that  I have the most positive connotations with. This artist is <i>Chancelor Johnathan Bennett</i>, aka, Chance the Rapper. Chance’s music is a combination of rapping and a singer songwriter sound. Chance started creating music in high school after an suspension in his senior year he recorded his first mixtape <i>10 day</i>. He then released it in April 2012. The mixtape was downloaded more than 300,000 times which caught Forbes Magazine’s eye and they promoted him in the Cheap Tunes column. Chance was then featured on Childish Gambino’s sixth mixtape on the song <i>“They Don’t Like Me”</i> and Gambino asked Chance to join his tour in 2012. Which increased his popularity tremendously. He then released his mixtape <i>"Acid Rain"</i> in April of 2013. This mixtape was nominated for best mixtape at the 2013 BET Hip Hop awards. He then released his next mixtape in May 2016 called <i>“Coloring Book”</i>. Coloring won best mixtape at the 2016 BET hip hop Awards. The same year at the BET hip hop Awards he was nominated for lyricist of the year, and won best new hip hop artist. Chance achieved his dreams really quickly, from making his first mixtape in 2011 to winning best new hip hop artist in 2016 is amazing.</p>
        <p>I heard multiple songs the first time I ever heard by chance the rapper. They were Juice, Favorite, song and his feature on Worst Guys by Childish Gambino it was in February 2014 at my first house party. When I first heard Chance the Rapper there was this feeling of comradery between me and those around me. His music hypes me up and is easy to commit the lyrics to memory which automatically makes any song better. It was one of the first times I felt unsurmountable, on top of the world. Chance’s music makes me think of good times, spontaneous adventures, and people I love. One of my favorite tracks by Chance is “Everybody is Somebody’s Everything”. The lyrics on this track are very easy to resonate with. Another of my favorites is “Lost”. My impression of Chance overall hasn’t changed, his music is continuously good and always a blast to listen to.</p>
